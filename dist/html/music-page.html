      I wrote, recorded, and produced my first EP, Look At Me, and released it in September 2018 under the name
      Kale. I recorded the vocals in the basement of my childhood home and produced the songs using ProTools.
      Instrumentals were created using a piano, a microKorg, and a variety of software synths. It is now
      available for streaming and purchase on
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2z6VdvsPkCV5viCdOfDZGq?si=lGBhCV5QTbSts3i955cCzA">Spotify</a>,
      Apple
      Music, iTunes, and anywhere else music is
      available!<br>
      Following my first EP, I took some time to focus and polish my recording, production, and songwriting
      skills both on my own, and while working an internship at a recording studio in Cambridge, MA. I have since
      released two more singles, a second EP, and have a lot more on the way!
