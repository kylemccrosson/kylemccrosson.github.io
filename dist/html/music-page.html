      Kyle wrote, recorded, and produced his first EP, Look At Me, and released it in September 2018 under the name
      Kale. He recorded the vocals in the basement of his childhood home and produced the songs using ProTools.
      Instrumentals were created using a piano, a microKorg, and a variety of software synths. It is now
      available for streaming and purchase on
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2z6VdvsPkCV5viCdOfDZGq?si=lGBhCV5QTbSts3i955cCzA">Spotify</a>,
      Apple
      Music, iTunes, and anywhere else music is
      available.
      Following his first EP, he took some time to focus and polish his recording, production, and songwriting
      skills both on his own, and while working an internship at a recording studio in Cambridge, MA. He has since
      released two more singles and has a lot more on the way!
