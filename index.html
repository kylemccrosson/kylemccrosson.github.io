          Kyle wrote, recorded, and produced his first EP, Look At Me, and released it in September 2018 under the name
          Kale. He recorded the vocals in the basement of his childhood home and produced the songs using Pro Tools.
          Instrumentals were created using a piano, keyboard, microKorg synthesizer, and a MIDI instrument. Much of the
          percussion and ambiences were recorded with a field recorder around the town he was raised in. It is now out
          for streaming and purchase on Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, and anywhere else music is available.

          While taking a Sound Design course, Kyle had the opportunity to record, design, and compose the sound effects
          and soundtracks for a series of silent videos. He learned how to give a sound perspective, how to be creative
          while finding materials to record sound effects, and how to use sounds and music to create a cohesive story.

        <p>
          Kyle worked in a group of three and had about a week to complete the sound design, given 'Inside the Body'
          with no sounds at all. He designed the heartbeat, electrical buzz, the siren, the cave ambience, the sounds
          of the levers, chains, and chair. He also recorded and designed the footsteps and the vocalizations.

          Kyle worked by himself and had about two weeks to complete the sound design, given a completely silent
          version of 'Otsu'. He composed and recorded the music using MIDI. He also designed all sounds in the entirety
          of the piece (some recorded by him- most metallic or garbage sounds- and others created from royalty-free
          sound effects).

          Kyle worked in a group of three and had about a week to complete the sound design for this piece, given
          'Crossing Guard' with no sound. He composed and recorded the music using MIDI (except for the rock song
          at the end), created the footstep sounds, recorded and edited all vocalizations, and assisted with the truck
          noise.
