      While taking a Sound Design course, I had the opportunity to record, design, and compose the sound effects
      and soundtracks for a series of silent videos. I learned how to give a sound perspective, how to be creative
      while finding materials to record sound effects, and how to use sounds and music to create a cohesive story.

      I worked in a group of three and had about a week to complete the sound design, given 'Inside the Body'
      with no sounds at all. I designed the heartbeat, electrical buzz, the siren, the cave ambience, the sounds
      of the levers, chains, and chair. I also recorded and designed the footsteps and the vocalizations.

      I worked by myself and had about two weeks to complete the sound design, given a completely silent
      version of 'Otsu'. I composed and recorded the music using MIDI software instruments. I also designed all sounds
      in the
      entirety
      of the piece (some recorded by myself,and others created from royalty-free
      sound effects).

      I worked in a group of three and had about a week to complete the sound design for this piece, given
      'Crossing Guard' with no sound. I composed and recorded the music using MIDI (except for the rock song
      at the end), created the footstep sounds, recorded and edited all vocalizations, and assisted with the truck
      noise.
