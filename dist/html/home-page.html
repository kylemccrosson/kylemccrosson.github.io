        I'm a graduating senior at Northeastern University, currently pursuing a combined BS degree in
        Computer Science and Music Composition/Technology. I'm graduating in May 2020, and will be looking for a
        position where I can bring my unique programming perspective and really make an impact.
        In my free time you can find me writing, recording, and producing music for myself and my friends.
